## Introduction

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Interactive 3x3 grid for gameplay.
- Displays the current player's turn.
- Detects win conditions and displays the winner.
- Identifies draw situations when all squares are filled.
- Option to reset the game at any time.


## How to Play

1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Player X starts and clicks on an empty square to place their mark.
3. Player O follows by clicking on an empty square to place their mark.
4. Players alternate turns until one achieves three marks in a row or all squares are filled resulting in a draw.
5. Click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.
